    ///   - CoreData sets all properties to nil during deletion

    ///       So coredata will actually set the storeApp but only issue is that it happens after init() is complete
    ///       hence we are using KVO so that one doesn't need to manually set the value via a setter method
    ///
    /// However this caused an issue when an object is marked deleted during merge policy conflict resolution, all its props are set to nil by coredata.
    /// this causes this KVO observer to be triggered and mutating the deleted entity causing a "coredata error: Mutating removed object"
    /// which is now handled by checking if context.deletedObjects doesn't contain it and version.isDeleted is not true yet
